Customer Churn Prediction Web App


‚óæOverview:-

This project presents a web application designed to predict customer churn using a machine learning model. The application provides an intuitive interface for users to input customer-related features and receive a prediction on whether that customer is likely to churn. This tool can assist businesses in proactively identifying at-risk customers and implementing retention strategies.

‚óæFeatures:-

Interactive Input: User-friendly interface to input various customer features.

Real-time Prediction: Get instant predictions on customer churn probability.

Model Insights: Built using a robust machine learning model.

MLflow Integration: Tracks model experiments and lifecycle for better management (backend focus).

‚óæTechnologies Used :-
This project leverages the following key libraries and tools:

Streamlit: For building the interactive web application interface.

PyTorch (torch): Potentially used for the underlying machine learning model's development or specific components (e.g., neural networks).

scikit-learn: For machine learning model development, evaluation, and data preprocessing.

Pandas: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical operations, especially with arrays.

Matplotlib: For data visualization (e.g., displaying model performance or feature distributions, though not directly exposed in the UI).

MLflow: For managing the machine learning lifecycle, including experiment tracking, model packaging, and model deployment (backend infrastructure).

‚óæ Model Details
The core of this application is a machine learning model trained to predict customer churn. It takes various customer attributes as input and outputs a probability or a binary classification (churn/not churn). The model was developed using a combination of PyTorch (if a deep learning model) and/or scikit-learn (for traditional ML models). MLflow was instrumental in tracking different model versions and experiments during development.
